\begin{abstract}
Set and multi-set constraints are very common in specification of data structures such as arrays or binary search trees.
Then, to verify the correctness of the implementation of such data structures, the verification tools need decision procedures for checking the satisfiability of such constraints.
This report provides a survey of the existing decision procedures for the constraints over set and multi-set of integers.
Moreover, it reports on an implementation of such decision procedure on the top of
existing solvers for arithmetical constraints.
