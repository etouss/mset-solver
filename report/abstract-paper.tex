\begin{abstract}
Set and multi-set constraints are very common in specifications of algorithms dealing with classic data structures such as array sorting or insertion on binary search trees.
The verification of the functional correctness of these operations requires decision procedures for checking the satisfiability of such constraints. 
This paper focuses on constraints over multi-sets of integers which may constraint the maximum or the minimum values stored in multi-sets. It surveys the existing decision procedures for such constraints and reports on an implementation of two such decision procedures on the top of existing SMT solvers.
